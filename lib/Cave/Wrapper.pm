=head1 NAME

Cave::Wrapper - A Wrapper to the Paludis 'cave' Client.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01100100

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<cave> is a package management client for the L<Paludis|http://paludis.pioto.org/> package manager available for use with both
the L<Exherbo Linux|http://exherbo.org/> and L<Gentoo Linux|http://gentoo.org/> Distributions.

This module is designed as a syntactic sugar wrapper for that client to minimize development time and clarify code.

    my $cave = Cave::Wrapper->new();
    my @ids = $cave->print_ids(qw( --matches  dev-lang/perl ));

=head1 METHODS

Methods are generated entirely at run-time by introspecting the output from C<cave print-commands --all> and then
generating the appropriate methods. This is mostly because we don't want to have to cut a new release every time
paludis produce a new release I<just> to avoid breaking code.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Naming Collisions

There exists 1 command we cannot perform a native mapping for, and its due to a perlism, and that is C<import>.

For now, this is named C<cave_import> instead.

=head2 Hyphenated Commands

Hyphenated commands can't be used as method names in Perl, so we've translated the hyphens to underscores
in the method names.

i.e.: if you wanted C<print-ids> you now want C<print_ids>

=head2 Slightly Under-powered

This is a first-pass "Just get it working" implementation at this time, and is reasonably useful for the print_ family of commands
the cave client provides. However, you probably do not wish to use it for more complex things like calling C<cave resolve> as it
might cause you untold sorrows while it silently buffers into a growing array and then spews its contents when its finished.

=head1 TODO

One day we'd like to have a sweeter syntax, like

    $cave->print_ids({ matches => 'dev-lang/perl' })

or

    $cave->print_ids({ matches => [ 'dev-lang/perl' , 'dev-lang/python' ]});

However, there are a few problems and questions to be answered, which are not a problem with the existing
syntax but would be a problem with a possible alternative syntax.

=item * Toggle Switches

There are a lot of toggle switches that don't take a parameter, and while we could just do

    $cave->print_commands({ all => 1 });

That means we have to get rid of the '1' before we pass the command to C<cave>, and that is going to be difficult to
do without needing tight coupling. Not to mention how to handle C<< all => 2 >> and C<< all => 1 >>.

=item * Fixed Order operations.

Some C<cave> functions require operators to be ordered, so if you needed to do this

    cave foobar --matching foo --not --matching bar

having a structure

    $cave->foobar({ matching => [ 'foo', 'bar' ]} , '--not' )

would obviously not work.

    $cave->foobar([ matching => 'foo', not => matching => 'bar' ])

or anything not using a hash is going to be equally confusing, especially as we can now no longer tell what
is a key and what is a value, so adding '--' to the front of them becomes impossible.
