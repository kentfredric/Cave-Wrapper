Cave::Wrapper

"cave" is a package management client for the Paludis
<http://paludis.pioto.org/> package manager available for use with both
the Exherbo Linux <http://exherbo.org/> and Gentoo Linux
<http://gentoo.org/> Distributions.

This module is designed as a syntactic sugar wrapper for that client to
minimize development time and clarify code.

    my $cave = Cave::Wrapper->new();
    my @ids = $cave->print_ids(qw( --matches  dev-lang/perl ));
